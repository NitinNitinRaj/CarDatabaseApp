Car CRUD App
This is a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) app for managing a list of cars. It has a backend built with Spring Boot and a frontend built with React, and it uses a MariaDB database to store the data. It also includes Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and uses Spring HATEOAS to provide links to related resources.

The backend includes a many-to-one relationship between cars and their owners, but this relationship is not currently implemented in the frontend.

Getting Started
Server
First, make sure you have all the requirements installed and a MariaDB database running. Then, create a new database and user for the app, and add the database connection details to the application.properties file in the src/main/resources directory.
To run the server, navigate to the server directory and run the following command:
mvn spring-boot:run
This will start the server on port 8080.

Client
To run the client, navigate to the client directory and run the following commands:

Copy code
npm install
npm start
This will start the client on port 3000.

Functionality
The app allows you to create, read, update, and delete cars in the list. It also has JWT authentication, so you will need to sign in to be able to access the list of cars.
